### Hi there 👋, Welcome to Vincent's Github

I am an student at UC Berkeley studying CS  and Math. I like machine learning. 
- 🔭 My research interests include large-scale ml systems, edge computing/tiny ml, deep generative models, continual learning, and AI alignment.
- 🌱 In my spare time, I like to design & build stuff, read philosophy, and play guitar.
- 🖋️ I also have a [personal blog](https://vincentwu.me), where I share some of my hobby projects and write about random stuff.


I've only recently started participating in the open source community, so feel free to reach out if you want to collab 👯 !
